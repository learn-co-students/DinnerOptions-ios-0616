/*
 PART 1
 Create a MenuItem class which has the following properties:
 1) a name, which can change and is a string
 2) a recipe, which is really just a dictionary of ingredients (strings) as keys and the associated amount of that ingredient needed as values (ints).
 Neither the name or recipe for a MenuItem can ever be nil.
 Write a designated initializer for a MenuItem.
