 PART 2
 Create a Restaurant class which has the following properties:
 1) the name of the restaurant, a string
 2) the cuisine of the restaurant, a string
 3) the supplies on hand at the restaurant, which is a Dictionary of ingredients (strings) as keys and their amounts as values (ints)
 4) the owner of the restaurant, which is a Person object(we'll create the person class in step 3)
 5) the menu for the restaurant, an array of menu items
 6) the restaurants current list of orders, which even if there are none should exist. This is a dictionary where the key is the table number and the value is an array of MenuItem objects.
 Only the menu of the restaurant can ever be nil, since some restaurants don't have menus.

    var owner: Person

    var orders: [Int:[MenuItem]]? // the restaurants current list of orders, which even if there are none should exist.
    
    //  This is a dictionary where the key is the table number and the value is an array of MenuItem objects.  Only the menu of the restaurant can ever be nil, since some restaurants don't have menus.
    
    //    Now write methods that do the following:
    //    1) An initializer that includes the name of the restaurant, its cuisine, and its owner.

        self.name = name

     2) Place an order. This method should take an array of string objects (the order as given by the customer) and a tableNumber and add the completed order to the orders property. It should only add to the order if what was requested is on the restaurant's menu.

 3) Make an order. This method should take a table number as an argument.
 
 It should look for the associated order placed for that table in the orders dictionary,
 
 and return the completed order (an array of menuItem objects), assuming that the restaurant has all of the necessary ingredients on hand to make the order.
 
 If the restaurant does not have the necessary amount of ingredients on hand to cook a specific menuItem ordered, it should return a partially completed order,
 
 and print in our console the menuItem objects for which it did not have the full ingredients on hand to make.*/
